### 🤝 Icebreaker. 🎭 Dare Game. 😂 Laughter Generator.

**Komma** is the ultimate challenge game designed to break the ice, spark laughter, and create unforgettable group moments.

## 🧩 Game Concept

> “Tired of boring small talk?”

In Komma, players draw digital cards with **hilarious**, **awkward**, or **daring** challenges. Every round is a new surprise and an opportunity to discover something unexpected about your friends… or yourself.

---

## 🚫 Penalty System

At the start of the game, players select a **penalty** — something mildly uncomfortable, funny, or wild.

> Didn't complete a challenge?  
> 🧊 Drink a sip, 🍋 bite a lemon, 💃 do a funny dance — **whatever penalty you agreed on**.

This mechanic adds tension and excitement — and ensures that nobody escapes the fun.

## 🛠️ What I Built & Learned

> _"Komma was a moment of revelation for me – I realized that in Unity, you can create anything your heart desires."_ ❤️

- 🧱 **Prefab-based architecture**  
  I used prefabs for cards, effects, buttons, and UI elements – allowing fast iteration and easy challenge customization.

- 🗃️ **Modular Design**  
  Each system (UI, audio, card logic, game flow) was built separately for better scalability and maintenance.

- 🚀 **App Store Deployment**  
  I published the game to the App Store and experienced the full development cycle – from concept to production.
